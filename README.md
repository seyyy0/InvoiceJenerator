# InvoiceJenerator
Simple invoice generator in Java. Made using Swing and iText.

Hey, it works ;). Even on multiple platforms (Windows and Linux)
Attached is the .jar, but you can check out the code yourself and make artifacts.

Note to self:
> Should probably make tests or something, wouldn't be the first ones I make.
> Could also be more ObjectOriented, since it is Java at the end of the day.
> The UI sucks, but then again, it works :).
